                        <h3>1976 - Born in Phoenix, Arizona</h3>
                        <p>Chester was born in Pheonix, Arizona. His mother was a nurse, while his father was a police
                            detective who worked on child sexual abuse cases. He had a brother called Brian Bennington.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>He took an interest in music at a young age: since he learned how to talk he would tell
                            everybody that he was gonna grow up to be a singer. His brother played Foreigner records all
                            the time and by the time Chester was two he used to run around singing their songs. As
                            Chester grew older, he started developing his distinctive singing style. "I did it all the
                            wrong way. I basically went at it till it didn't hurt anymore. Its something I've been
                            blessed with." His favorite band was Ministry and he would always try to mimic Al
                            Jourgensen's highly produced/compressed vocals the best he could, without using any effects.
                            Other groups he listened to were Depeche Mode, The Cure, The Misfits, Fugazzi, Minor Threat,
                            The Smiths, Skinny Puppy and Neitzer Ebb. In school, he got into musical theater, started
                            playing music, and traveled the country with a stage production of You Are The Child.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Chester was a victim of sexual abuse from an older male friend when he was seven years old.
                            He was afraid to ask for help because he did not want people to think he was gay or lying.
                            The abuse continued until he was 13 years old. Years later, he revealed the abuser's
                            identity to his father, but chose not to press charges.</p>

                        <h3>1987 - Parents divoce</h3>
                        <p>Chester's parents divorced when he was 11 years old. During this time, the abuse and his
                            situation at home affected him so much that he felt the urge to run away and kill people. To
                            comfort himself, he drew pictures and wrote poetry and songs. After the divorce,
                            Bennington's father gained custody of him. Bennington started abusing alcohol, marijuana,
                            opium, cocaine, meth, and LSD. He was physically bullied in high school. In an interview, he
                            said that he was "knocked around like a rag doll at school, for being skinny and looking
                            different".</p>

                        <h3>1991 - Joins the band 'Sean Dowdell and His Friends?'</h3>
                        <p>One of Chester's friends was a pretty good guitar player and was looking for someone who
                            could sing. Chester said "I can sing." So they both broke into the church behind a house,
                            stole a microphone and started doing music together. They learnt every The Doors song they
                            could play and when Chester started doing his first compositions, they were very influenced
                            by them. He said, "We liked them as they were so poetic, spacey and deep. So it was
                            something along those lines."</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>This opened the door to some other young musicians that have been in bands and they invited
                            Chester to audition in his first band, 'Sean Dowdell And His Friends?'. The second he opened
                            his mouth to sing Pearl Jam's "Alive", everyone in the room was blown away by his immense
                            potential and they immediately decided to recruit him.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Once the band was put together, they wrote about 10 songs and learnt about 10 cover songs
                            including "I Wanna Be Sedated" by The Ramones, "Would" by Alice In Chains and other songs by
                            Stone Temple Pilots, Guns N Roses, and Pearl Jam. None of the members took the band very
                            seriously, but soon they had a following and started producing marketing material such as
                            t-shirts, flyers, stickers, and pictures of the band. They also recorded a self-titled
                            cassette tape containing 3 of their original songs â€” their only songs ever recorded in
                            studio.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>For over a year and a half, they played 50-70 shows around the Phoenix area. Some of them
                            taking place at the Greenway High School, where Chester and bass player Jason Cekoric went
                            to school. Chester was constantly late to practice and it became a problem for everybody in
                            the band after a while. When he got in trouble with drugs at school and his dad grounded him
                            for a long time, affecting his ability to play with the band. Chester was reportedly kicked
                            out after he had a fight with the band manager. Chester returned before long, however, the
                            band had run its course by that time and it ultimately ended.</p>

                        <h3>1993 - Joins the bad 'Grey Daze' along with friend Dowdell</h3>
                        <p>Grey Daze has released has released 4 studio albums: 2 with Chester and the latter 2 released
                            released after his death but featuring his pre-recorded vocals.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Shortly after the split up of Sean Dowdell And His Friends?, Sean started a new band with a
                            bassist he met through his brother. They put up an ad on Phoenix New Times to find a guitar
                            player and vocalist, and soon found a guitarist. They tried out a few different singers but,
                            for various reason, they didn't work out. After listening to the Sean Dowdell And His
                            Friends recording, Steve suggested to try and ask Chester to come back and audition for this
                            new band as well, so the band invited him. Chester joined the band right away.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Originally, the band members were going to call themselves Lovelies Bleeding, but later
                            decided to settle on "Gray Daze".</p>
